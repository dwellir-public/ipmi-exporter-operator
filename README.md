# IPMI Exporter
Prometheus [IPMI Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/ipmi_exporter) for IPMI metrics

## Quickstart

Deploy the `prometheus-ipmi-exporter` charm and relate it to the units you want
to export the metrics:

```bash
$ juju deploy prometheus-ipmi-exporter ipmi-exporter
$ juju relate prometheus-ipmi-exporter tiny-bash
```

The charm can register it's scrape target with Prometheus via relation to the
[Prometheus charm](https://charmhub.io/prometheus2):

```bash
$ juju deploy prometheus
$ juju relate prometheus-ipmi-exporter prometheus
```

The charm supports [cos-lite](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/editions/lite) 
```bash
$ juju relate prometheus-ipmi-exporter grafana-agent
```

## Preferred metrics relation

The preferred relation for new integrations is `metrics-endpoint` with interface
`prometheus_scrape`.

This path preserves Juju topology labels through the standard provider library
and works directly with `alloy-vm:metrics-endpoint`. Use it when metrics will
be forwarded onward to a remote write backend such as `mimir-vm`.

```bash
$ juju deploy prometheus-ipmi-exporter
$ juju deploy alloy-vm --config enable-syslogreceivers=true
$ juju integrate prometheus-ipmi-exporter:metrics-endpoint alloy-vm:metrics-endpoint
$ juju integrate alloy-vm:send-remote-write mimir-vm:receive-remote-write
```

Compatibility note:

- `prometheus` remains available for older Prometheus-specific deployments
- `metrics-endpoint` is the preferred relation when you want Juju topology preserved end to end

## Developing

We supply a `Makefile` with a target to build the charm:

```bash
$ make charm
```

## Testing
Run `tox -e ALL` to run unit + integration tests and verify linting.
